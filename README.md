1. Project Title
The Sauciers' Saucy Soup Generator
2. Decription
 This program creates soup recipes using a genetic algorithm that has an inspiring set of 6 recipes. It starts with the inspiring set and crosses recipes over with themselves, creating new recipes. These new recipes then have a chance to mutate where the set of mutations include adding an ingredient, deleting an ingredient, swapping one ingredient with another, and changing the amount of a certain ingredient. The next generation uses an inpiring set that consists of the fittest 50% of the previous inspiring set of recipes and the fittest 50% of the  most recently crossed over and possibly mutated set of recipes. Fitness is decided by the number of ingredients. The number of generations is decided by the user.
 3. How to run the project
 Press run  and then input the amount of generations you want the recipes to be mutated over. The resulting file consists of the top 5 fittest recipes (you can find them in the fittest recipes folder).
